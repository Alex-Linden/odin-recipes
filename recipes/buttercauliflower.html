    <p>I have made this recipe several times and it is amazing. It come from <a href="https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/indian-coconut-butter-cauliflower/#bo-recipe">HalfBakedHarvest.com</a>. It is quick and easy to make and last for days. I also make extra and enjoy the leftovers for a few days.</p>

    <h3>The Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large head cauliflower, cut into florets</li>
        <li>2 1/3 cups canned full fat coconut milk</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced or grated</li>
        <li>2 inches fresh ginger, grated</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garam masala</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons yellow curry powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper ,more or less to taste</li>
        <li>1 can (6 ounce) tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons coconut oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh cilantro, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>steamed rice and naan, for serving</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>The Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the broiler to high. Grease a baking sheet with olive oil.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the cauliflower, 1/3 cup coconut milk, 2 cloves chopped garlic, 1 tablespoon grated ginger, and a pinch of salt. Let sit 10 minutes to "marinate". Spread the cauliflower in an even layer on the prepared baking sheet. Transfer to the oven and broil for 3-4 minutes, until the cauliflower is just beginning to char on the edges.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook 5 minutes or until fragrant. Add the remaining garlic and ginger, cooking another 5 minutes. Stir in the garam masala, curry powder, turmeric, and cayenne, and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato paste and remaining 2 cups coconut milk. Stir to combine, bring the sauce to a boil, cook 5 minutes or until the sauce thickens slightly. Stir in coconut oil. If the sauce seems thick, thin with 1/2 to 1/2 additional coconut milk or water. Add the cauliflower and any juices on the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens slightly, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the cilantro. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Serve the cauliflower and sauce over bowls of rice with fresh naan and mango chutney, if desired. Enjoy!</li>
