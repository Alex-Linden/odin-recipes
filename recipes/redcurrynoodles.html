        <li>2 zucchini or summer squash diced</li>

        <li>fresno peppers, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook rice noodles according to packaged directions. </li>
        <li>Heat the sesame oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook until golden, about 3 minutes. Stir in the coconut and cook until the garlic is crisp and the coconut is toasted, about 2 minutes. Spoon the mix out of the skillet and drain onto a paper towel, season with salt.</li>
        <li>Return the skillet to medium heat. Add the zucchini and cook 2-3 minutes until softened. Stir in the curry paste and ginger and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour in the coconut milk, 1/3 cup water, soy sauce, and honey. Stir to combine, bring the mixture to a boil, cook 5 minutes or until the sauce thickens slightly. If the sauce thickens too much, add additional water to thin. Remove from the heat and stir in the lime juice and basil.</li>
        <li>To serve, divide the noodles and sauce between bowls. Top with peppers, fresh basil, and the fried garlic.</li>
    </ol>
