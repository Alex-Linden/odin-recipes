    <h1>The Stew</h1>
    <img src="../Pics/thestew.jpeg" alt="Bowl of the Stew">
    <p>This is #thestew, Alison Roman’s internet-famous 
        recipe, as delicious as it is beautiful. Spiced 
        chickpeas are crisped in olive oil, then simmered 
        in a garlicky coconut milk for an incredibly 
        creamy, basically-good-for-you dinner that evokes 
        South Indian chickpea stews and some stews found 
        in parts of the Caribbean. While the chickpeas 
        alone would be good as a side dish, they are further 
        simmered with stock, bolstered with dark, leafy greens 
        of your choosing and finished with a handful of fresh 
        mint. </p>
        <h3>The Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>60ml olive oil, plus more for serving</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
            <li>1 large yellow onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 thumb-sized piece ginger, finely chopped</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper</li>
            <li>1.5 tsp ground turmeric, plus more for serving</li>
            <li>1 tsp mild chilli flakes, plus more for serving</li>
            <li>2 14oz cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed</li>
            <li>2 tins full-fat coconut milk</li>
            <li>270ml vegetable or chicken stock</li>
            <li>1 bunch Swiss chard, kale or collard greens, stems removed, torn into bite-size pieces</li>
            <li>yogurt, for serving (optional)</li>
            <li>Toasted pita, for serving (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Heat 60ml oil in a large pot over medium. Add garlic, onion and ginger. Season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally until onion is translucent and starts to brown a little at the edges, three to five minutes</li>
            <li>Add 1½ teaspoons turmeric, one teaspoon mild chilli flakes, and the chickpeas, and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, so the chickpeas sizzle and fry a bit in the spices and oil, until they’ve started to break down and get a little browned and crisp, eight to 10 minutes. Remove about a cup of chickpeas and set aside for garnish.</li>
            <li>Using a wooden spoon or spatula, further crush the remaining chickpeas slightly to release their starchy insides. (This will help thicken the stew.) Add coconut milk and stock, and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Bring to a simmer, scraping up any bits that have formed on the bottom of the pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until stew has thickened, 30 to 35 minutes. (Taste a chickpea or two, not just the liquid, to make sure they have simmered long enough to be as delicious as possible.) If after 30 to 35 minutes, you want the stew a bit thicker, keep simmering until you’ve reached your desired consistency. Determining perfect stew thickness is a personal journey</li>
            <li>Add greens and stir, making sure they’re submerged in the liquid. Cook until they wilt and soften, three to seven minutes, depending on what you’re using. (Swiss chard and spinach will wilt and soften much faster than kale or collard greens.) Season again with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Divide among bowls and top with mint, reserved chickpeas, a sprinkle of chilli flakes and a good drizzle of olive oil. Serve alongside yogurt and toasted pita if using; dust the yogurt with turmeric if you’d like.</li>

        </ol>
        <p><strong>Tips:</strong>  When shopping, be sure to avoid low-fat coconut milk, coconut milk meant for drinking or cream of coconut. None are suitable here. Two cans of coconut milk, really? Yes</p>
